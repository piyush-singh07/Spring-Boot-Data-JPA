* DMImplementation --->  DerivedMethodsImplemetation
* A demo application implementing DeriveMethods / Derived  Queries using CRUDRepository.
* As CRUDRepositories inbuilt methods only work with the Primary Key .Hence , in this example we will see how we can retrieve
  data from Database without using Primary Key.
* Derived Ouery Methods lets us define the abstract methods and remove the overhead of writing queries.
